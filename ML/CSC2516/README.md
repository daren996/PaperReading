### Gradient Descen

Why gradient descent, if we can find the optimum directly? 

- GD can be applied to a much broader set of models

- GD can be easier to implement than direct solutions, especially with automatic differentiation software
- For regression in high-dimensional spaces, GD is more efficient than direct solution (matrix inversion is an O(D3) algorithm).
