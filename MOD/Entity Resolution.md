  #### What is Entity Resolution?

  Problem of identifying and linking/grouping different manifestations of the same real world object.

  Examples of manifestations and objects:

  - Different ways of addressing (names, email addresses, FaceBook accounts) the same person in text.
  - Web pages with differing descriptions of the same business.
  - Different photos of the same object.

  （把不同表达的同一个事物弄一块去，在数据库中就是对不同条目进行整合）

  #### Taditional Challenges in ER

  - Name / Attribute ambiguity
  - Errors due to data entry
  - Missing values
  - Changing attributes
  - Data formatting
  - Abbreviations / Data truncation
  - Big-Data Setting: Larger and more Datasets, More Heterogeneity, More linked, Multi-Relational, Multi-domain, and Multiple applications. 

  #### Notation

  - R: set of records / mentions
  - M: set of matches (record pairs that correspond to same entity )
  - N: set of non-matches (record pairs corresponding to different entities)
  - E: set of entities
