# Action Localization



### Metrics

IoU (intersection over Union) = area of overlap / area of union

AP (average precision) = the average value of p(r) over the interval from r=0 to r=1

AP = âˆ«P(R)dR

mAP (mean average precision) = mean of the average precision scores for each query

NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression) 

#### IoU

At this stage, experiments are performed only on a few videos. 
There is no way to calculate precision, recall, etc. 
IOU is used to measure the performance of the method.

IOU = Intersection / Union of predicted frames and true labeled frames



### Todo

I planned to test more videos but they didn't finish running.

I will try more metrics in next week. 
Measurement of cohesion, precision and recall.
